**Core Elements of the Coffee Sales Dashboard**
*Order Date Filter:*
Use a timeline slicer to allow users to select specific periods or a range of months for deeper analysis.
*Sales Over Time:*
Utilize a line chart to depict sales trends across different coffee types over time. This can help in identifying seasonal peaks and troughs.
*Top Five Customers:*
Display a bar chart showing the top five customers by sales value. This could be dynamically updated based on the selected time period.
*Sales Per Country:*
Integrate a bar chart or even a map visualization if possible to show sales distribution by country. This should highlight the countries with the highest sales, aiding in geographic market analysis.
*Sales Per Coffee Type:*
Use a pie chart to display the proportion of total sales contributed by each coffee type. This visual can quickly inform which coffee types are most popular.
*Sales Metrics by Roast Type:*
Implement a series of bar charts or small multiples to compare sales metrics across different roast types (Dark, Light, Medium). This could include average sales value, number of transactions, and profitability.
*Loyalty Card Analysis:*
Analyze sales by customers with and without a loyalty card using a stacked bar chart to show the impact of loyalty programs on sales.
*Size-wise Sales Analysis:*
Explore the sales performance of different product sizes (0.2 kg, 0.5 kg, etc.) using a column chart. This can help in understanding consumer preferences for package sizes.
